                    <hr class="light">
                    <p>I am an engineer, programmer, and life-long learner. I was drawn to programming, and subsequently my passion for computers, because I enjoy solving problems. For me, computer programming is simply an extension of my real-world problem solving skills. When I’m presented with a problem I tackle it using logic, critical thinking, and experimentation.</p>

		    <p>As an electrical and biomedical engineering student, I have had the opportunity to take a deep look into a variety of subjects: mathematics, physics, electronics, chemistry, biology, software design, and even nanotechnology. Being able to draw from a wide range of subjects and synthesize that knowledge to create something new is what engineering, and problem solving, is all about.</p>

                    <p>My love of solving problems has fed into my love of learning. From a young age I have wanted to learn as much about everything as possible, because the more I know, the more problems I can solve. To quote Albert Einstein, <strong>“No problem can be solved by the same consciousness that created it.”</strong></p>
